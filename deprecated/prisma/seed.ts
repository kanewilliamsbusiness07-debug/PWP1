/**
 * Legacy Prisma seed script (moved during migration to DynamoDB/S3)
 *
 * This file was retained for historical reference only. The project now uses
 * DynamoDB for user storage. To seed the Users table, use:
 *
 *   npm run seed:dynamodb
 *
 * Do NOT run this script in production environments.

// Original Prisma seed moved to repository history. See `scripts/seed-users.ts` for the new DynamoDB-based seeder.
